There are two projects in this repo one is with docker configuration and other one is without docker
If you want to start to docker project then first make pull from the repo and target the directory folder.
After that just run this command "docker-compose up -d -V --build --remove-orphans" make sure you have docker deomon installed 
in your machine.

In this project dynamodb and redis are runnning inside docker yous just need to run the docker docker with above command after
which you can access the node services at your localhost:3000/

API's for this service are 
-localhost:3000/resgister  //for registering providers POST type.
-localhost:3000/providers  // for listing providers from dynamodb GET type
-localhost:3000/kue-app    // for redis dashboard

Note as i have not mounted the volumne inside the container make sure to down the docker before starting it again and agian.


The project which is without docker for that you have to local run the redis server on your mackine to make kue work.
Once the redis server is up and running and then you just need to start the server by command yarn start.
Rest of the api's are same as above.
Test coverage Report is in the propject coverage folder which is running without the docker
